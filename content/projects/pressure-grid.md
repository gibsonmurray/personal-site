**_"Feeling the pressure?"_**

This emulates a touch-sensitive pad that can be used to control different things. On touch release a crosshair of cells will meet at the point of release.

I saw a neat [demo](https://x.com/createwithplay/status/1834540554299826338) and wanted to recreate it in the only way I know how! Added some of my own special touches and shot it out into the universe!

This was my first Codepen project to take advantage of jQuery and SASS alongside GSAP.
