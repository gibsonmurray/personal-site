A hypnotic dance of desert technology and Arrakian wildlife unfolds in this 2D scene. Watch as a solitary thumper strikes the sun-baked earth, its rhythmic pulse rippling across the dunes. In the distance, a colossal sandworm emerges, its segmented form a silhouette against the shimmering horizon. This slice of Dune's harsh beauty comes alive through the unlikely alchemy of pure HTML and CSS.

Born from a late-night creative surge and a deep appreciation for Frank Herbert's universe, this project pushed the boundaries of web technologies. Each keyframe was meticulously crafted to capture the essence of Arrakis - from the subtle sand ripples to the awe-inspiring presence of the great worm. The result is a testament to both the power of modern CSS and the enduring allure of science fiction's most iconic desert planet.
