**_"The winners of the 2024 Olympics are..."_**

An interactive widget built with React and Framer Motion that displays the number of medals won by the top 4 countries during the 2024 Olympics in Paris, France.

This was not my first React project but it was one of my first one really experimenting with Framer Motion. I was initially going to do 99 more days of experimentation but then I decided to get a job. In the meantime doing these demos is a fun hobby!
