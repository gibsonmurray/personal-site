**_"A hook grabs a user's attention, a story keeps it, and design delights them."_**

One of my first experiments with GSAP. I was playing around with the idea of a "hero section" and how to make it more engaging. I came across Poppr's website and thought it would be a great idea to make a similar one, but with a twist.

I took inspiration from his website to create a minimalistic design with a focus on the content. I wanted to create a design that would be simple to understand, but also engaging to use. I also wanted to create a design that would be responsive, and that would work on both desktop and mobile.

I used GSAP to create a cursor following animation, and a text splitting effect. I also used GSAP to create the rainbow shimmer effect on the button when hovered over.

I'm happy with the way it turned out (I do not take credit for the design, I only take credit for the code).
