**_"A new Mac just a scroll away!"_**

This project was insired by [Nate Smith's portfolio website](https://natesmith.design/). My goal was to create a parallax effect, transitioning one device to another. GSAP timelines are used to animate the entire flow.

The purpose of this excersize was to understand complex timelines and scroll animations. When I saw the effect on Nate's site I _had_ to give it a go. He used framer, but I used skill ;) (jk)

Most of the videos/assets are pulled straight from [Apple's](https://www.apple.com/) website, otherwise it is built from the ground up with CSS.
