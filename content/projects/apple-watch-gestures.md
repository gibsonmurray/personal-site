**_"Convenience is the complement of efficiency"_**

When Apple launches a website, it tends to be a tad stunning.

I was browsing their website one day and noticed that they had a section on the page that showed off their Apple Watch Gestures, new to the series 9. I thought it would be a cool idea to create a similar section to practice my scroll-based animation skills.

This is where GSAP really shines. ScrollTrigger is a game-changer for scroll-based animation and should be in every front-end dev's toolkit. With this tool, I was able to create a seamless animation that feels natural and fluid, emulating the Apple Watch gestures section.

Demos really help bring a concept to life and solidify your understanding of the technology, no matter how simple they are.
