**_"And they said Snapchat deleted photos..._"**

I wanted to challenge myself by recreating [Emil Kowalski's demo](https://x.com/emilkowalski_/status/1784929942712541462) of deleting photos in a stylish way. I only used GSAP to create the animations. This is all done with vanilla JavaScript. I did not like doing it in vanilla JS, but I wanted to see how far I could get without tools like React.

Tutorials can help you, but they will only get you so far. Practice is the best way to learn programming. If you want to really improve, try to build something just by looking at the demo.
