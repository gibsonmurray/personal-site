**_"It's raining widgets!"_**

Imagine a downpour of vibrant, interactive widgets cascading down your iPhone 14 Pro screen. Each widget, a tiny marvel, scales and scrolls smoothly, creating a mesmerizing visual experience. As you swipe, the widgets dance and twirl, making your device feel alive with endless possibilities. Dive into the flood and explore the magic of seamless animation and dynamic content, all at your fingertips.

This project is inspired by a landing page (that I cannot quite remember) that I saw a while ago. I thought it would be a fun challenge to recreate the effect using SVGs and GSAP.
