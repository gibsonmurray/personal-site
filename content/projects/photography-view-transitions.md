**_"Peeking into Framer Motion"_**

My entry for a small competition on X/Twitter. The goal was to create a view transition effect for a social media-inspired design. I took a relatively simple approach.

This was before I knew about the `layoutId` prop so the timelines are crude but do the job. This would not be ideal to scale with though.

For those looking to really dive into Framer Motion's layout animations here is a [great blog post](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/framer-motion-layout-animations/) really explaining it!
