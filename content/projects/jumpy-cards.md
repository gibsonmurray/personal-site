**_"So subtle, yet so eye-catching"_**

A very simple project with a few cards that jump on launch. Mimics Airbnb's micro-interactions as seen on their mobile app. It uses a simple GSAP tween used to stagger the scales of the cards. Images are from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

I built this to experiment with making a tutorial. I posted the tutorial on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/GibsonSMurray/status/1811980098502787267). It ended up being featured on Codepen and it only took me 40 minutes to program! Kind of a speed run if you ask me.
