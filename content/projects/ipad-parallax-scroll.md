**_"Shifting perspectives"_**

This is a small project designed to gain more experience with GSAP and to learn how to create a scrolling effect.

In this project, I delved into the captivating world of parallax scrolling, where background images move slower than the foreground images, creating an illusion of depth. By leveraging the powerful GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), I aimed to craft a smooth and visually appealing scrolling experience.

My goal was to implement seamless scrolling animations that enhance user experience, create a multi-layered scrolling effect to add depth and dimension, and ensure the effect works flawlessly across different devices, especially on iPads. Additionally, I focused on performance optimization to maintain high performance and smooth animations.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with GSAP, understood the principles of parallax scrolling, learned to optimize animations for performance, and enhanced my skills in creating responsive web designs. By the end, I had a deeper understanding of how to create engaging and performant scrolling effects using GSAP, and how to apply these techniques to enhance user experience on various devices.
