**_"Bright ideas can't stay hidden"_**

A simple sticky notes app that allows you to add, edit, and delete notes. It uses local storage to save the notes and has realistic animations to make it feel more interactive.

This was a fun project to make. I made the notes sticky looking by using a CSS linear gradient. I also used GSAP to animate the notes when they are added, deleted, and edited. The textboxes dynamically resize to fit the text. and the notes are easily draggable (Using GSAP Draggable). The background is similar to a billboard, just like we are at the office!

If you really want to wreak havoc, you can even ~delete~ _all_ the notes with a swipe of the hand!
