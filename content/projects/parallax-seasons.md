**_"Seasons-a-changin'"_**

One of my most popular projects on Codepen, this is a simple parallax effect that I created using just HTML, CSS, and JS. The effect is triggered when the user moves their mouse across the screen. By default, the season on desplay is the current one in the United States. However, users can change the season by clicking on the menu. 

This was my entry to getting highly featured on the Codepen trending page and newsletter. It is still one of my most liked and saved demos.
