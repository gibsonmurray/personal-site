**_"The future awaits... or does it?"_**

Imagine a Bash shell with knowledge of the universe and the future of what is to come... The Magic Terminal is an interactive Codepen built with hidden lore. It will answer your questions but sometimes it reveals a bit more than you asked for.

This was initially going to be text transition experiment (see the random characters flashing before the real letter is revealed), but then it ended up going further. I programmed a remote server to fetch from the OpenAI API and prompted it to take on a personality.

The vibe was supposed to be a mysterious shell that has a personality and I referenced the macOS terminal to create the design.

Super fun to build and toy with AI!
